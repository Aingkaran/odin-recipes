    <ul>
        <li>Split skinned black gram/Urad dal – 250g</li>
        <li>Cold water – 30ml to 50ml</li>
        <li>Onion – 40g</li>
        <li>Green chili – 5 to 7</li>

    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li> Take the Urad dal in a bowl and add some water. The water should stay above the urad dal. Leave it to soak for at least 4 hours.</li>
        <li>Rinse the urad dal well and drain off any excess water. Add some salt and mix everything.</li>
        <li>Now grind everything to paste (Not a smooth paste). When you grind, add a little cold water which would help to soften the Vadai. (Refer Note 1 and Note 2) </li>
        <li>After grind everything, you will get a mixture as shown in the picture below. Leave it for 2 to 3 hours before making Vadai.</li>
        <li>Chop the onions, green chilies, and curry leaves as shown in the picture below.</li>
        <li>Now add chopped onions, green chilies, and curry leaves to the mixture.</li>
        <li>Mix everything well.</li>
        <li>Heat the oil in a frying pan.</li>
        <li>Keep a bowl of water beside you. Wet your hands. Take a medium sized mixture ball and place it on the wetted palm.</li>
        <li>Slightly pat the mixture and make a hole at the center as shown in the picture below.</li>
        <li>Now turn the flame to low and put the Vadai into the heated oil. Flip it to the side to side until the Vadai turns into nice brown color.</li>
        <li>This is how to make Ulundu Vadai in Sri Lankan Style. Serve and enjoy this best and soft Ulundu Vadai.</li>
