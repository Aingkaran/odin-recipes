    <p>There's nothing like a good mutton roll after a long night of partying and drinking! This is a must have snack at every Tamil Sri Lankan party!</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Boneless mutton – 500g</li>
        <li>Potato – 500g</li>
        <li>Onion – 250g</li>
        <li>Green chili – 5 or 6</li>
        <li>Curry leaves – Few</li>
        <li>Minced ginger – 1 tablespoon</li>
        <li>Curry powder – 3 tablespoon</li>
        <li>Turmeric powder – ½ teaspoon</li>
        <li>Lime – ½</li>
        <li>Salt – As you need</li>
        <li>Cooking oil – As you need</li>
        <li>Water – 1750ml</li>
        <li>Breadcrumbs – 250g</li>
        <li>Salt – as you want</li>
       
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li> Rinse the mutton and cut it into tiny pieces. Also, cut the potato into small pieces as shown in the picture below. Besides, chop the onion, ginger, curry leaves, and green chilies. Apart from all, get ready with lime, curry powder, turmeric powder, salt, and cooking oil.</li>
        <li>Heat the oil and add half of the onion. Sauté them till translucent. Then add green chilies and curry leaves. Sauté them till onion starts turn to golden.</li>
        <li>Now, add the mutton, turmeric powder, and salt. Give a good mix. </li>
        <li>Cook covered under high flame for 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add potato and curry powder. Give a good mix.</li>
        <li>Cook covered under medium flame until all the liquid evaporates. For me, it takes about 10 minutes. Taste a piece of mutton, if it is not cooked well enough add some water and cook again.</li>
        <li>Now add the rest of the onion and ginger. Stir, mix and cook for one or two minutes under medium flame.</li>
        <li>Finally, switch off the flame and squeeze the lime. Also, adjust salt if needed and give one last good mix. This is how to make the best spicy typical Jaffna style curry for mutton rolls.</li>
        <li>Take a large bowl, add all-purpose flour and salt. Mix them well. Add the water little by little while mix them using a whisk. Mix well until all dissolved thoroughly. For me, it takes about 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Take ¾ of the smooth batter for making the dosa (wrapper) and leave the rest for dipping the rolls.</li>
        <li> Heat the dosa pan and make dosa as shown in the picture below. You don’t need to flip the dosa. Cook one side is enough to make the rolls.</li>
        <li>Now put the curry on top of the dosa and make the rolls as shown in the picture below.</li>
        <li>Do the same until you finish the mutton curry.</li>
        <li> Take the breadcrumbs and the rest of the smooth batter</li>
        <li>Dip each roll inside the batter and then coat them with the breadcrumbs as shown in the picture below.</li>
        <li>Do the same to all the rolls you made.</li>
        <li>Now heat the oil in a deep frying pan and fry the rolls under the high flame until they turn golden brown. For me, it takes about 4 minutes for each batch.</li>
        <li>This is how to make the best Jaffna mutton rolls without frozen wrappers. Serve and enjoy these typical Jaffna-style soft and crispy mutton rolls.</li>
